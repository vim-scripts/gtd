A file-type plug-in and syntax file for the Vim editor that provides readers of David Allen's book, "Getting Things Done", a way to manage their task lists from within Vim.

Screenshots, installation instructions and a user's guide is available at:

This is my first Vim script, so if anyone has any recommendations (especially to improve portability and compatibility with other Vim versions) please contact me.
